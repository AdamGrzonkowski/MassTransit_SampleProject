             * Code below, after When(OrderSubmitted), ensures that if some later state, like OrderAccepted (which comes after OrderSubmitted) is actually
             * processed first (because in truly distributed systems we can't guarantee order of execution, so we must take such scenario into consideration)
             * we'll take some useful data, which is unique for OrderSubmitted state (and therefore it's not yet included in Saga Instance), like "SubmitDate" and store it in Saga instance, but without actually changing the State
             * from OrderAccepted back to OrderSubmitted, because that makes no sense;
             * State Machine is describing actions taking place in time. Since OrderAccepted happens after OrderSubmitted, it makes no logical sense to transition to earlier State
